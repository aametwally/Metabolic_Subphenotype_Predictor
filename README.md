# Metabolic Subphenotype Predictor

This repository includes code used in the Metabolic Subphenotyping study (currently under review). The study aims to predict the four main Type 2 Diabetes metabolic subphenotypes (muscle insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, impaired incretin action, and hepatic insulin resistance) from OGTT glucose timeseries performed at the clinical research unit and home using CGM.

This repo contains:
1. Preprocess and analyze OGTT glucose time series and extract metabolic indicators: src/metabolic_suphenotype_analysis.R
2. ML models (training and validation): src/metabolic_subphenotype_ml.py
3. Data (metadata, glucose time-series from plasma and CGM, and genotyping) will become available once the paper is accepted.
